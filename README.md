# E-commerceProject
This e-commerce was made the explore and practice my skills in DOM
The project could be more complex using a date base, but at the moment
I wanted to use only javascript.

# ReponsiveLayout
Whit a responsive layout, the website works well in pc and mobile

At the end I would like to let a note:
"This website is one of my best, I really put some effort on it
and I kwon tha it could be more useful with a registration part
and a upload and delete products part for its owner, probally
it will be updated very soon to implement these functions"
